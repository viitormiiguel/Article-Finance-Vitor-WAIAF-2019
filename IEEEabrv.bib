USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEabrv,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Trans. Automat. Contr."


IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies -
this file is suitable for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.


For work that requires full-length titles, you should use the full
titles provided in the companion file, IEEEfull.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
 
 3. Abbreviations follow IEEE's style.

 4. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

 5. The following NEW/current journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been verified:
    
    STRING{IEEE_J_CBB        = "{IEEE/ACM} Trans. Comput. Biology Bioinformatics"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_CJECE      = "Canadian J. Elect. Comput. Eng."}
    STRING{IEEE_J_DSC        = "{IEEE} Trans. Dependable Secure Comput."}
    STRING{IEEE_O_DSO        = "{IEEE} Distrib. Syst. Online"}
    
 6. The following OLD journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been found/verified:

    STRING{IEEE_J_BCTV       = "{IEEE} Trans. Broadcast Television Receivers"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_EWS        = "{IEEE} Trans. Eng. Writing Speech"}

If you know what the proper abbreviation is for a string in #5 or #6 above,
email me and I will correct them in the next release.

    abstract = "Big data created by social media and mobile networks provide an exceptional opportunity to mine valuable insights from them. This information is harnessed by business entities to measure the level of customer satisfaction but its application in disaster response is still in its inflection point. Social networks are increasingly used for emergency communications and help related requests. During disaster situations, such emergency requests need to be mined from the pool of big data for providing timely help. Though government organizations and emergency responders work together through their respective national disaster response framework, the sentiment of the affected people during and after the disaster determines the success of the disaster response and recovery process. In this paper, we propose a big data driven approach for disaster response through sentiment analysis. The proposed model collects disaster data from social networks and categorize them according to the needs of the affected people. The categorized disaster data are classified through machine learning algorithm for analyzing the sentiment of the people. Various features like, parts of speech and lexicon are analyzed to identify the best classification strategy for disaster data. The results show that lexicon based approach is suitable for analyzing the needs of the people during disaster. The practical implication of the proposed methodology is the real-time categorization and classification of social media big data for disaster response and recovery. This analysis helps the emergency responders and rescue personnel to develop better strategies for effective information management of the rapidly changing disaster environment."

    abstract = "Pre-processing is the first step in text classification, and choosing right pre-processing techniques can improve classification effectiveness. We experimentally compare 16 commonly used pre-processing techniques on two Twitter datasets for Sentiment Analysis, employing four popular machine learning algorithms, namely, Linear SVC, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks. We evaluate the pre-processing techniques on their resulting classification accuracy and number of features they produce. We find that techniques like lemmatization, removing numbers, and replacing contractions, improve accuracy, while others like removing punctuation do not. Finally, in order to investigate interactions—desirable or otherwise—between the techniques when they are employed simultaneously in a pipeline fashion, an ablation and combination study is contacted. The results of ablation and combination show the significance of techniques such as replacing numbers and replacing repetitions of punctuation."

In this paper we are using some feature selection techniques such as Mutual information, Chi-Square, Information gain and TF-idf to select features from high dimensionality of feature set. These methods are evaluated over the dataset which contains 2000 review data about MOVIES. The classification is performed using support vector machine provided by weka9 tool. We also investigate that which is best feature to extract sentiments from the reviews. We are considering unigram, bigram, POS tags of words and function words as our feature set."
